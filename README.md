# Kickstarter Data Analysis  

Data analysis and visualization using charts and pivot tables in Excel.

## Description

This repository is designed to uncover market trends by analyzing and visualizing data from 4,000 Kickstarter projects. 
### Data tab
- Conditional formatting is used in the **State** column to color code projects as successful (green), failed (red), canceled (yellow), or live (grey). 
- The **Percent Funded** column uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal, and conditional formatting is used to color code funding amounts (0-99; red, 100-199; green, 200; blue).
- The **Average Donation** column uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
- The **Category** and **Sub-Category** columns use formulas to split the **Category and Sub-Category** column into two parts.
